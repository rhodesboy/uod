	         <h3>MBChB</h3>
	         <p class="lead">Dundee is an excellent place to study medicine, both for the high quality of the teaching programme and for the facilities available. Problem-orientated, student-centred and community-based, our medical course closely follows recommendations for 'Tomorrow's Doctors' made by the professional governing body for medicine in the UK, the General Medical Council.</p>



	       
	        <p>Understanding how the brain functions in both health and disease is one of the great challenges of this century.</p>
   <p>Such studies are vital as we seek to better understand and treat neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and neurological disorders such as epilepsy.</p>

	  
  </div>
  <div class="tab-pane fade " id="why"><h3>Why study Medicine at Dundee?</h3>
			<p>In Dundee you have the opportunity to study medicine in a fully integrated medical school and hospital with extensive teaching and research facilities, which serve both teaching and clinical needs. Ninewells Hospital and Medical School is the centre of many areas of pioneering research in cancer, keyhole surgery, heart disease, drug development, and medical education.</p>
			<p>You will be part of a caring community providing healthcare for Tayside, Fife, and further afield, and have access to a wide range of facilities including lecture theatres, teaching laboratories, library, integrated self-teaching area, computer suite and a leading Clinical Skills Centre. A new education facility is being built on the Ninewells Hospital site which will further enhance the quality of our teaching.</p>

			<h4>Professional accreditation</h4>
			<p>This programme is fully accredited by the professional governing body for medicine in the UK, the General Medical Council (GMC).</p>
			
			
			<h4>What's so good about Medicine at Dundee?</h4>
			<p>In the 2010 National Student Survey we were ranked 2nd in Scotland and 4th in the UK, and 94% of our students said they were satisfied with the quality of the course.</p>
			
			
				<h4>Elective study</h4>
				<p>In your final year you have the opportunity to travel anywhere in the world to undertake a period of elective study.</p>
				<p><a href="/admissions/student_graduate_profiles/gordon_hale/">Gordon Hale</a>, 5th Year Medical Student says "The best experience so far has to have been my elective, the chance that every medical student has between 4th and 5th year to travel abroad and experience medicine in another country for 6 weeks. I chose to travel to Grenada in the West Indies and had a fantastic time".</p>
			
			
			<h3>Who should apply?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Students who have done well at school and are committed to medicine.</li>
				<li>Individuals with other broader interests demonstrating leadership, organisational and communication skills.</li>

			</ul>
			
			
				<h4>Interviews in Asia</h4>
				<p>Short listed applicants can choose to be interviewed in Dundee or Kuala Lumpur. </p>
			



			<h3>Premedical year</h3>
			<h4>Widening Access Premedical Option</h4>
			<p>In 2010 Dundee medical school allocated up to 6 places within the premedical year for local applicants (Tayside and Fife) with proven evidence of adverse circumstances leading to significant educational disadvantage.</p>

			<h4>Premedical Year for Non-science background</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Very able applicants who have a predominantly non-Science background (i.e. those who have not studied either Higher or A-Level Chemistry) will be considered for the pre-medicine year.</li>
				<li>Passing with satisfactory grade average guarantees your entry into the medical course itself.				</li>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="employability"><h3>Careers</h3>


<p>Medicine is a rewarding career path and being a doctor involves a lifetime of learning. Once you have completed your undergraduate medical course, you will undergo a period of postgraduate training which incorporates foundation training followed by a period of higher training. When you begin your foundation training you will be entitled to a salary from the NHS.</p>

<p>Foundation training is competency based and runs over 2 years, most commonly 6 x 4 month posts with full registration with the General Medical Council (GMC) achievable after Foundation year 1.
At the end of Foundation training, if competencies are achieved, then doctors will be able to apply for specialty training.</p>

<p>There are currently over 60 specialties available, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Anaesthesia</li>
<li>Intensive Care Medicine  </li>
<li>Emergency Medicine  </li>
<li>General Practice  </li>
<li>Medicine  </li>
<li>Obstetrics and Gynaecology  </li>
<li>Occupational Medicine  </li>
<li>Ophthalmology  </li>
<li>Paediatrics  </li>
<li>Pathology  </li>
<li>Psychiatry Information  </li>
<li>Public Health  </li>
<li>Radiology  </li>
<li>Surgery</li>
</ul>



<h4>Alternative careers</h4>
<p>Gaining an undergraduate medical degree provides you with many skills and experiences that you could offer to a potential employer in another field.  These include communication skills, empathy and sensitivity, problem solving, coping with pressure, professional integrity, team working and decision making.</p> 
  
<p>If you wish to move out of clinical practice, other sectors that you could consider are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Medical journalism (although many undertake this as an addition, rather than an alternative to their clinical work)</li>
<li>The Civil Service - medical experience could be utilised in an advisory capacity or as substantial background when working with central government departments such as the Department of Health or Ministry of Defence.</li>
<li>Law - this might include working in clinical areas like forensic pathology, or within medical ethics, or in a medical advisor role within law firms or other organisations.</li>
<li>Medical research - researchers conduct experiments and analyse results in an effort to learn more about the human body. This can  result in new drug development or improvements in medically-related  products.</li>
</ul>

<p> There is information about how UKCAT is used in our selection  process in the UKCAT section under 'Your  Application' .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            
			<h3>Notes on entry requirements:</h3>
			<ul>
              <li>All       Highers and A-Levels applicants must have obtained these qualifications at       the same time and&nbsp;first opportunity. &nbsp;Applications with re-taken qualifications       are not considered.&nbsp; &nbsp;Applicants       will not be advantaged or disadvantaged if their school policy requires       examinations to be taken at different times.</li>
			  <li>If Biology       has not been passed at Higher or A-Level this subject must normally have       been passed as indicated under entry requirements. &nbsp;<br />
			    An appropriate group of SQA (formerly       SCOTVEC) National Certificate modules may be accepted as an alternative to       Standard Grade Biology. &nbsp;<br />
			    A good pass       in Combined or Dual Science at GCSE may be accepted instead of a single       GCSE pass in Biology. &nbsp;<br />
			    A Physics       qualification is not an entry requirement. &nbsp;However, knowledge of Physics is helpful       to students on the course.</li>
			  <li>Human       Biology or Social Biology is accepted as an alternative to Biology at       Higher or A-Level.</li>
			  </ul>
			<h3>Other expectations </h3>
			<p>Via the personal statement on the UCAS  form applicants are expected to demonstrate:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A        range of suitable personal attributes such as motivation, commitment,        social contribution, teamwork/leadership and excellent communication        skills.</li>
                  <li>Some        knowledge of, and commitment to, medicine. Thus we encourage up to two        weeks of medically-related work or shadowing experience.</li>
                <li>An        awareness of the course and University to which they are applying.</li>
                <li>A        satisfactory reference.</li>
			  </ul>
			<p>We reserve the right to require  applicants to provide details regarding activities described on UCAS personal  statements (such as contacts regarding work experience) and shall investigate a  number at random as well as any suspect claims.&nbsp; Misleading statements may  lead to an application being rejected.</p>
			<h3>Pre-medical year</h3>
			<h4>Widening Access Premedical Option (A 104)</h4>
			<ul type="square">
              <li>Since 2010 Dundee Medical School has allocated up to 6       places within the premedical year for local applicants (Tayside and Fife) with proven evidence of adverse circumstances       leading to significant educational disadvantage. </li>
			  <li>Applications will be considered from school pupils who       have achieved AABBB at Higher in S5 or equivalent.&nbsp; In addition       applicants will be required to provide evidence of significant adverse       circumstances such as '1st in family' to higher education, limited family       income, neighbourhood or home circumstances not conducive to study,       education affected by adverse events at critical times or other       exceptional factors.&nbsp; </li>
			  <li>Additional references and interview will be required       subject to satisfactory Multiple Mini Interviews (MMI) performance. Additional support structures are       in place for this student group. </li>
			  <li>Passing the pre-medical year with satisfactory grade average (B3 or above) and MMI performance is required for progression onto the medical course itself.</li>
			  </ul>
			<h4>Premedical Year for Non-science background (A 104)</h4>
			<ul>
              <li>Very able applicants who have a predominantly       non-Science background (i.e. those who have not studied either Higher or       A-Level Chemistry) will be considered for the pre-medicine year. </li>
			  <li>Passing the pre-medical year  with satisfactory grade average guarantees       your entry into the medical course itself.</li>
			  </ul>

			<h4>UCAS Application Process</h4>
			<iframe src="http://embed.buto.tv/69dr7" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<br />


			<h3>How will my application be assessed?</h3>
<p>Applications are ranked on academic achievement and UKCAT score. The top  550 will be invited to select an interview time to suit them via our online  booking tool. We also invite applicants to provide information about any  adverse circumstances which could have affected their education and  applications will then be ranked again using this extra information and  approximately another 50 invitations to interview will be issued.</p>
<p>From the 2013 entry cycle the aspects  scored are :</p>
<h4>Academic</h4>
					<p>All applicants must offer our minimum  academic requirements but those with evidence of higher academic achievements will  be rated more highly. We consider the primary qualification (A levels, Highers,  Degree class etc) and also the relevant previous stage (GCSE, Standard Grades,  School exit exams etc. as appropriate). So past achievements are relevant as  are exceptional achievements such as 6 Highers A grades in one sitting, Masters  degrees, PhD etc. The high level of competition means the minimum  qualifications will rarely secure an interview without an exceptional UKCAT  score.</p>
					<h4>UKCAT</h4>
                    <p>Your UKCAT score will be factored into the pre-interview rank. There is  no specific cut off applied but obviously a high score is advantageous.<br />
                      <br />
Our analysis of the 2013 applicants revealed the average calculated from  applications received was 2520 and the average for those gaining offers was 2720. </p>
                    <p> Applications without UKCAT will be rejected. </p>
<p>Please visit the <a href="http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/">UKCAT website</a> for information about the test, two complete practice tests, important dates and information about bursaries available</p>
<h4>Other Non-Academic Achievements</h4>
<p>From 2013 cycle information on  non-academic achievements and references will not be considered until  interview. </p>
					<p> Thereafter, we aim to rate  applications as fairly as possible based upon the various forms of other  evidence which is presented on the UCAS form. There is no ideal formula and we  would not wish to promote particular activities. Hence we consider these under  separate headings, which receive equal weight.</p>
<p> Some examples are given below but this  list is not exclusive or exhaustive. The selectors will consider achievement in  all areas and prefer evidence in more than one area. Non-academic achievements  will be discussed at interview and we may seek confirmation of these at our  discretion.</p>
                    <ul type="square">
                      <li>Competitive achievement – e.g.       chess or sport at national level or above </li>
                      <li>Talents – music, drama, public       speaking, leadership qualities </li>
                      <li>Social responsibility –       voluntary work, teamwork, youth organisations </li>
                      <li>Employment – entrepreneurial,       sustained engagement, achievement					</li>
</ul>
                    <h4>Medical Experience</h4>
					<p>We encourage up to two weeks relevant  work experience (or equivalent) as it is helpful for providing awareness of and  insight into career choice. This will be discussed at interview but is not  scored. We do not credit the volume of work experience and would discourage  applicants seeking to acquire experience in excess of that required to inform career  choice. We do not encourage work experience in resource poor settings where you  may be exposed to risk or take up scarce staff time.</p>
					<p> Please note we intend to ask applicants  to inform us where their experience has been acquired and verify a selection.</p>
<h4>Contextual Assessment</h4>
					<p>Dundee Medical School seeks to operate as  transparent and fair admissions process as possible. To assist this we have  introduced a formal system by which candidates can inform us of major adverse  factors which they believe have had a significant impact on their application.  Examples might be personal illness or a role as a carer.</p>
					<p> We invite all applicants to do so  through a web based questionnaire in October. These are used as described in  the relevant section. Please note <strong>ALL </strong>claims will require supporting documentary evidence and/or an  additional interview if an offer is being made because of an adjustment for an  applicant's background.</p>
<h4>Reference</h4>
					<p>The professional assessment offered by the referee on the UCAS form is  also considered.&nbsp;</p>
					<h4>Weighting  of components</h4>

					<p>The precise weighting of the components is reviewed 'in cycle' each year  and may be modified according to the distribution of scores presented and in  the process of considering contextual factors. However, the basic schema  balances the Academic score (60%), UKCAT decile (40%) for school leavers and UKCAT  decile (60%), Academic score (40%) for graduates. Following interview, provided  the process has run smoothly, candidates are ranked on the interviews score  alone, i.e there is a 'clean slate' with no carryover of the pre-interview  rank.</p>
